# Deep neural network from scratch
My implementation of deep neural network from scratch for a deeper (no pun intended) understanding of neural network. You can find my implementations under the own folders. In each folder, you will find the code as well as implementation of the functions on some simple machine learning task.

Here are the implementation in this repo:

* Logistics regression
* Simple neural network with one hidden layer
* Deep neural network implementation
* Deep neural network application: image classification

Credit of the materials in the repo goes to [deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai). You can take the deep learning course @ Coursera [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?)
